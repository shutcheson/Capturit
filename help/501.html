            knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
            under the age of 16. If You are a parent or guardian and You are
            aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please
            contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data
            from anyone under the age of 16 without verification of parental
            consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.

            If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your
            information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may
            require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
            information.
